# Pseudo-Credit-System

Credit Card System / Java

Developed a sophisticated credit card management system using object-oriented principles.

Utilized constructors, getters & setters, and custom methods to create accounts, make purchases, display transaction reports, & set credit card limits.

Implemented a modular architecture by introducing distinct classes, such as person, credit card, and item, to allow for the creation of objects that seamlessly interacted with one another.

Incorporated encapsulation to ensure the security and integrity of the program.
